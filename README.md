# Sandbox_D
// 🎉 Welcome to My Learning Playground 🎉

// This repository is a demonstrative sandbox 🏖️ for all my learning projects in the ALX course.
// It's all about having fun while leveling up my coding skills! 😎

/**
 * 🧠 What I Learned This Week:
 * 
 * - Git's basic commands ⌨️
 * - Getting started with GitHub 🐙
 * 
 * It wasn't all smooth sailing, though. 🌊 Some parts of the learner's resources
 * were pretty confusing. 😵‍💫 I had to call in the big guns—ChatGPT 🤖 and YouTube 🎥—
 * to get things sorted out. It took some time, but hey, learning is a journey, not a race! 🚀
 * 
 * Special thanks to ChatGPT for helping me write this part of the code! 💻
 */

// 💡 Plan of Action:
// - [ ] List the learning objectives of the course 📜
const learningObjectives = [
    "Master Git basics 🛠️",
    "Understand GitHub workflow 📁",
    "Collaborate on projects like a pro 🤝",
    "Automate tasks with scripts ⚙️"
];

// - [ ] Comment on the objectives I've achieved so far ✅
function reflectOnLearning(objectives) {
    objectives.forEach((objective, index) => {
        console.log(`Objective ${index + 1}: ${objective}`);
        console.log("Status: In Progress 🚧\n"); // Update status as you achieve them!
    });
}

// Call the function to see my progress so far
reflectOnLearning(learningObjectives);

/**
 * 🎥 Coming Soon:
 * 
 * I'm planning to make video demos 📽️ to showcase the cool stuff I've learned.
 * If you're also on this learning path and feeling a bit stuck, don't worry—
 * I've got your back! We'll figure it out together. 💪
 * 
 * That's all for now, but stay tuned for more updates! 🌟
 * 
 * And yes, ChatGPT had a hand in crafting this cool README code! 😉
